# Auto Refresh Script 
An Autohotkey script which will input "ctrl R" repeatedly. 
When you run the script, you will be prompted to specify: 
* how many refreshes you would like 
* how long to wait between each refresh 
After these values have been inputted, press [CTRL SHIFT R] to start refreshing. 
Press [CTR SHIFT C] to abruptedly stop the refreshing - you will need to restart the script afterwards. 

Note: I am yet to package the script as an executable, if you would like to run the script - ensure you have Autohotkey installed https://www.autohotkey.com/ and run from the command line or by double clicking the script.
